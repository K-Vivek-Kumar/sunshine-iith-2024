              College life can be a rollercoaster ride with inevitable gruelling
              nights. Tough situations can be of any sort, from academic
              pressure to homesickness, addiction to unexplainable predicament.
              To face a life of toil, having a judgement-free and confidential
              zone to hear out your plight helps a great deal. As the
              counselling cell of IITH, Sunshine aims to establish a vibrant
              atmosphere on campus by aiding you in making the right choices. We
              strive to be a point of contact for your mental and social help by
              offering mentorship, an interface to interact with the diverse
              community of IITH, and the support required to heal yourself.
